var boss_2 = "Get to work, kid."

var day_1 = "The cart is FROZEN SOLID, all my equipment is in there. I guess I will have to use my trusty ol’ pick here, even if it is pretty slow."
var day_2 = "I don’t recognize a thing, all the stone, ice and rock moved overnight. Sometimes I wonder, could the ice be… living. Nevermind, that’s a silly thought."
var day_3 = "I should be careful, if i stay out too long i will freeze to death. Best to stay near the surface, the further down the colder it gets."
var day_4 = "I can hear the Ice creaking, is it trying to speak to me? I must be going insane from all the mining."
var day_5 = "There are more gems the deeper I go. I just don’t know if I’m prepared to go down there. The ice is… uncanny."
var day_8 = "THE ICE... IT’S TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING. I’M SURE OF IT. I JUST NEED TO... GO DEEPER."
