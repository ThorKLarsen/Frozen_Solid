A small mining game made for the "1-BIT JAM #5" set in a twisted ever-changing icescape on a distant mining planet.
You can play/download the game here: https://asimithehero.itch.io/frozen-solid

Your boss demands you hand him ores worth 10.000 credits before 10 days, but the frost reaches deep and you don't have any other tools than your trusty pickaxe. 
Mine as many ores and gems as you can before you freeze to death, hopefully you will return home before that happens. Upgrade your equipment and become the mining powerhouse you were always meant to be.

Controls:
A, D - Left and right movement
Space - Jump
M - Mine
M + W - Mine up
M + S - Mine down
E - Crafting menu (Yes you can only craft torches. No i don't think it's stupid to have a whole menu just for this)
1 - Place torch
Additionally you can wall climb by holding A or D respectively. You can also mine either left/right or up while wall climbing.
